Project 3: Around The U.S.

A space where users can make a profile of places they've travelled, as well as interact with other users' profiles.

As opposed to previous projects which utilized briefs, Around The U.S. utilzed Figma for the images, text, and dimension specifications for the desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts. Flexbox, grid, and media queries were essential in creating each one. Most elements have media queries starting at max-width: 620px, though a few have them at max-width: 800px.
